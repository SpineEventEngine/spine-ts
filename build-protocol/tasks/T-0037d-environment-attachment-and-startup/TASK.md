# T-0037d: Environment Attachment And Startup

Status: Candidate; not started

Dependency: T-0037c complete and integrated.

## Objective

Make `ServerEnvironment` the sole package-internal delivery owner for
registration attachment and finite startup recovery, including cardinality,
attribution, and registration-scoped failed-start rollback before listener
integration.

## Human-Imposed Requirements Ledger

- Implement only this child in its future isolated branch/worktree with one
  author, TDD, focused checks, and all four required review lanes.
- Preserve existing public `ServerEnvironment` construction/options and add no
  public attach, detach, generation, scheduler, monitor, or retry surface.
- Use T-0037a descriptors, T-0037b coordination, and T-0037c records; do not
  duplicate their ownership.
- Keep generated Protobuf output out of VCS and do not touch
  `human-review-1-jul.md`.

## Exact Ownership

This child owns the package-internal lifecycle gate for attach/startup, one
delivery generation per environment, caller-owned shared registration
cardinality, server-owned exclusivity, registration tokens, startup recovery
admission, post-persist readiness routing, and failed-start rollback. It
assembles startup obligation scopes from T-0037a's built-context descriptors,
including actual storage factories and enumerated tenants, installs readiness,
and awaits one finite recovery result before declaring attachment ready.

The child exposes an internal attachment handle for future server integration.
It does not yet change `Server.start()` or listener ordering.

## Likely Files

- `packages/server/src/server/server-environment.ts`
- New package-internal environment lifecycle/generation modules under
  `packages/server/src/server/` or `packages/server/src/delivery/`
- Minimal package-internal access additions to T-0037a/T-0037b/T-0037c modules
- Focused server-environment attachment/startup tests
- This task's future durable task/work/review records and narrow architecture
  wording

## TDD Acceptance

- Multiple caller-owned registrations share exactly one generation/coordinator;
  an environment-owned registration is exclusive, with conflicts rejected
  before registration or work admission.
- Startup installs readiness after context assembly, enumerates pre-existing
  supported tenant work using each built context's actual storage, and awaits
  one finite recovery obligation.
- Fulfilled `FAILED`, `PAUSED`, or `SKIPPED` is observed without claiming all
  pending rows completed; fulfilled `FAILED` alone does not fail startup.
- Rejection overlapping the attaching scope fails startup; wholly disjoint
  sibling rejection allows exactly one unaffected startup admission without
  restarting rejected scope or recursive readmission.
- Failed startup closes only the attaching registration's admission, waits for
  endpoint-dependent active work, consumes/reports only eligible causes, and
  preserves sibling progress/readiness/records.
- An already-reported unresolved overlapping shared cause produces exactly the
  D-0085 plain startup blocker message and no original-cause chain.
- A sole failed attachment quiesces its empty generation internally while a
  caller-owned environment remains reusable; permanent close remains T-0037e.

## D-0085 Invariants

- Exactly one environment owner and generation seam exists across attached
  servers.
- Startup recovery completes before network intake, though server listener
  wiring is deferred to T-0037f.
- Notification is readiness-only and follows durable persistence.
- Cleanup never deletes pending rows or closes a shared environment wholesale.
- Rejection attribution uses T-0036 per-shard evidence and T-0037c ownership;
  no unrelated registration is blamed.

## Explicit Exclusions

No public lifecycle option, final `Server.start()` wiring, network intake,
ordinary detach, reusable generation retirement, environment close, facility
close, retry timing, monitor/action API, topology, or T-0036 redesign belongs
here.
