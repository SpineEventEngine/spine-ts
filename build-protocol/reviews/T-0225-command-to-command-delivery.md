# T-0225 Command-to-Command Delivery Review

## Architecture checkpoint

The first GREEN attempt exposed same-runtime Command Bus reentrancy when a
command-input `@Command` handler posts its transformed Command after committing
the current Entity transaction.

The existing `requirements_splitter` role is assigned a read-only architecture
checkpoint covering the smallest compatible follow-up enqueue seam, transaction
ordering, failure behavior, Inbox/retry semantics, causal metadata, and JVM
command-substitution parity. Expected model `gpt-5.6-sol` and expected reasoning
`high` are explicit in the dispatch. The role must not edit files or spawn
subagents.

The checkpoint accepted the existing package-owned path:
`runtimeAccess.enqueueFollowUp()` through
`commandBusAccess.postInternalFollowUp()`. Child envelopes are derived and
packed inside the Entity transaction, Entity state commits, and the returned
detached Inbox callback enqueues the children. The active Command Bus item must
not await a same-runtime child.

The callback must invoke child posts in declaration order, collect every
completion, then await them together. Sequential await would stop sibling
admission after the first failure; discarded promises would create unhandled
rejections. Existing Inbox containment and diagnostics remain authoritative.

The checkpoint also established these mandatory corrections:

- Command substitution produces one or more Commands. JVM
  `CommandSubstituter.fromEmpty()` and the current TS analyzer both reject zero
  output, so task acceptance criterion 4 must be corrected rather than widening
  the public contract.
- A serialized `command-transformation` kind cannot be added under registry
  version 3. The format must advance atomically or avoid a serialized-shape
  change.
- Public assignment lookup must not silently change meaning; transformation
  lookup needs a clearly named receptor seam or a preserved assignment-only API.
- Remove heuristic or unused event-input classification.
- Prove duplicate/mixed receptors, event/rejection regression, true public
  client posting, ordered fan-out, failure observation, metadata lineage,
  immediate close/drain, and durable source-row retry behavior.
- The post-commit in-process callback is best-effort, not an atomic outbox. T-0225
  must not claim durable exactly-once delivery across a process crash between
  commit and enqueue.

Runtime self-introspection will be recorded when exposed. Otherwise, the
immutable configured role/profile and explicit dispatch fields are the accepted
metadata evidence.

## Implementation continuity

The original implementation owner completed and pushed the runtime, reference,
Aggregate, and rollback increments, then exhausted its execution window while
scoping the remaining metadata fixture. It left no uncommitted production or
test changes.

A replacement existing `implementer` role owns the remaining focused tests,
corrections, documentation reconciliation, and implementation records. Expected
model `gpt-5.6-terra` and expected reasoning `medium` are explicit in the
dispatch. The replacement must not spawn subagents. The original owner is idle,
so production ownership does not overlap.

## Canonical review dispositions

- Correctness/compatibility: pending after mechanical convergence.
- Style/maintainability: pending after mechanical convergence.
- TypeScript/API documentation: pending after mechanical convergence.
- Performance/reliability: pending after mechanical convergence.
- Reader documentation: pending after mechanical convergence.
- Security: N/A as a separate lane because this correction adds no credential,
  authorization, or external trust boundary. Remote rejection behavior remains
  a correctness concern.

## Mechanical preflight assignment

The orchestrator-dispatched verification function will run the cheap static
gates, focused handler/repository/black-box suites, and source-scoped coverage
before specialist review. Expected model `gpt-5.6-luna` and expected reasoning
`medium` are explicit because selecting valid changed-source coverage from the
shared server module requires classification judgment. The function is
read-only, must not spawn subagents, and may not edit or commit files.
