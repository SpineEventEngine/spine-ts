Reviewers must reject:

- direct delivery modes for normal server operation;
- worker loops, retry monitors, conveyor/stations, repository invocation,
  `Stand`, gRPC services, transport retry behavior, or example app work;
- deduplication based only on inbox record ID;
- in-process-only shard locks;
- public standalone helpers without a recorded reason;
- names over the four-component limit; and
- stale task/report/work-log state.
