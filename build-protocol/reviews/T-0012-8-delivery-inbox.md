# Review Log: T-0012.8 Delivery And Inbox

Status: round 1 changes requested
Branch: `task/T-0012-8-delivery-inbox`
Worktree:
`/Users/armiol/development/experiments/spine-ts/.worktrees/T-0012-8-delivery-inbox`
Baseline commit: `de3ccc7`

## Required Review Lanes

- code style/maintainability;
- documentation;
- TypeScript/API docs;
- security;
- performance/reliability.

## Review Focus

Reviewers must reject:

- direct delivery modes for normal server operation;
- worker loops, retry monitors, conveyor/stations, repository invocation,
  `Stand`, gRPC services, transport retry behavior, or example app work;
- deduplication based only on inbox record ID;
- in-process-only shard locks;
- public standalone helpers without a recorded reason;
- names over the four-component limit; and
- stale task/report/work-log state.

Result: changes requested.

Findings to address:

- duplicated process-local promise queues in inbox and shard storage;
- `InboxStorage` carries too many private responsibilities in one file;
- the public `DeliveryStrategy` / `LocalDeliveryStrategy` seam may be too early
  for this slice;
- hand-written public delivery message/status types and internal JSON `Any`
  records are too broad before Spine delivery protos are available;
- API overview omitted `ShardedWorkRegistryOptions`;
- shard pickup and inbox deduplication are not real cross-process
  compare-and-set operations over the current storage API;
- shard reads need an explicit UUID tie-breaker after receive time and version;
- paging/batch delivery must be either implemented or explicitly deferred;
- dedup retention must not trust caller-supplied receive time as the clock;
- malformed internal records and oversized payloads can poison reads or exhaust
  resources; and
- task/work logs must separately record that the local JVM Java delivery sources
  were absent and the local delivery proto directory was present but empty.

All five round-1 reviewer sub-agents were closed after their reports were
collected.
