## Required Review Lanes

Every review round must run these separate reviewer sub-agents:

- code style/maintainability;
- documentation;
- TypeScript/API docs;
- security;
- performance/reliability.

## Review Focus

Reviewers must reject:

- `Inbox`, delivery workers, `Stand`, gRPC services, import bus, scheduler,
  system context runtime, process supervision, or read-side query behavior;
- public repository-registration internals;
- large error/detail hierarchies;
- exported standalone helpers without a recorded reason;
- names over the four-component limit;
- tests under `src`; and
- stale docs/API expectations.

## Review Rounds

No review rounds have run yet.
