# T-0041 Review Log

Status: Security architecture split assigned; artifacts and final review pending

Baseline: `39f2c6f7`

Branch: `task/T-0041-final-project-security-gate`

## Review Contract

Use the full Human-Imposed Requirements Ledger, committed threat model,
security findings report, dependency audit evidence, current task/work status,
and a literal immutable review package. Ignore historical superseded text
unless current records or changed public docs claim it active.

Every security finding must include severity, attacker prerequisites, impacted
asset/trust boundary, exact repository evidence, existing controls, residual
risk, and the smallest correction. Do not elevate absent deployment-owned TLS,
auth, rate limiting, or production hardening into framework vulnerabilities
without evidence that the framework claims or bypasses those controls.

## Required Security Review

- Dedicated existing `security_reviewer`, explicit `gpt-5.6-terra` / high,
  only after the initial threat model, findings log, and dependency audit are
  committed.
- Scope: all public packages, Protobuf/generated boundaries, server/gRPC,
  storage/delivery, query/subscription, tenant routing, handler analyzer and
  generated registry loading, transport/ZeroMQ, testing utilities, example,
  docs, build scripts, and dependencies.
- Repeat after every accepted security-boundary fix until clean or a human
  explicitly accepts a documented residual risk.

## Canonical Concern Dispositions

- Style/maintainability: relevant to threat-model/report structure and any
  security fix; use existing Terra High reviewer.
- Documentation completeness: relevant to trust assumptions, mitigations,
  residual risks, and public docs corrected by findings; use existing Luna
  Medium reviewer.
- TypeScript/API docs: relevant to public trust/type/runtime claims and any
  changed contract; use existing Terra High reviewer.
- Performance/reliability: relevant to DoS, bounds, persistence, concurrency,
  lifecycle, and resource cleanup; use existing Terra High reviewer.
- Run the four concerns after security artifacts/fixes stabilize. Record a
  concrete N/A only for a wave whose changed behavior cannot affect that
  concern.

## Pre-Review Lint

Before every review wave, check synchronized status, duplicate policy values,
public/internal leakage, future-policy overclaim, secret/redaction hygiene,
tracked generated output, dependency-audit freshness, and diff integrity.

## Current Assignment

- Existing `requirements_splitter`, expected explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` /
  high, project-wide read-only security architecture split, no subagents or Git
  mutation.
- The splitter does not replace the dedicated final security reviewer.
- Splitter agent `019f62cb-d7fa-72b3-b0e9-d1ba22ff48c4`: explicit dispatch
  and immutable actual runtime profile `gpt-5.6-sol` / high, no subagents or
  Git mutation.
