# T-0041 Review Log

Status: Security Round 1 fixes coordinator-verified; review pending

Baseline: `39f2c6f7`

Branch: `task/T-0041-final-project-security-gate`

## Review Contract

Use the full Human-Imposed Requirements Ledger, committed threat model,
security findings report, dependency audit evidence, current task/work status,
and a literal immutable review package. Ignore historical superseded text
unless current records or changed public docs claim it active.

Every security finding must include severity, attacker prerequisites, impacted
asset/trust boundary, exact repository evidence, existing controls, residual
risk, and the smallest correction. Do not elevate absent deployment-owned TLS,
auth, rate limiting, or production hardening into framework vulnerabilities
without evidence that the framework claims or bypasses those controls.

## Required Security Review

- Dedicated existing `security_reviewer`, explicit `gpt-5.6-terra` / high,
  only after the initial threat model, findings log, and dependency audit are
  committed.
- Scope: all public packages, Protobuf/generated boundaries, server/gRPC,
  storage/delivery, query/subscription, tenant routing, handler analyzer and
  generated registry loading, transport/ZeroMQ, testing utilities, example,
  docs, build scripts, and dependencies.
- Repeat after every accepted security-boundary fix until clean or a human
  explicitly accepts a documented residual risk.

## Canonical Concern Dispositions

- Style/maintainability: relevant to threat-model/report structure and any
  security fix; use existing Terra High reviewer.
- Documentation completeness: relevant to trust assumptions, mitigations,
  residual risks, and public docs corrected by findings; use existing Luna
  Medium reviewer.
- TypeScript/API docs: relevant to public trust/type/runtime claims and any
  changed contract; use existing Terra High reviewer.
- Performance/reliability: relevant to DoS, bounds, persistence, concurrency,
  lifecycle, and resource cleanup; use existing Terra High reviewer.
- Run the four concerns after security artifacts/fixes stabilize. Record a
  concrete N/A only for a wave whose changed behavior cannot affect that
  concern.

## Pre-Review Lint

Before every review wave, check synchronized status, duplicate policy values,
public/internal leakage, future-policy overclaim, secret/redaction hygiene,
tracked generated output, dependency-audit freshness, and diff integrity.

## Completed Architecture Assignment

- Existing `requirements_splitter`, expected explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` /
  high, project-wide read-only security architecture split, no subagents or Git
  mutation.
- The splitter does not replace the dedicated final security reviewer.
- Splitter agent `019f62cb-d7fa-72b3-b0e9-d1ba22ff48c4`: explicit dispatch
  and immutable actual runtime profile `gpt-5.6-sol` / high, no subagents or
  Git mutation.
- Result accepted: ten trust boundaries, stable `TM-001` through `TM-012`
  hypotheses, dependency-audit classification, focus paths, and bounded review
  sequence. No final finding was adjudicated and no further architecture
  escalation was requested.
- Agent closed after acceptance.

## Pending Artifact Author

- Existing `implementer`, expected explicit `gpt-5.6-terra` / medium, bounded
  to the two security artifacts and durable evidence entries, with no
  production-code changes, subagents, or Git mutation.
- The dedicated `security_reviewer` remains pending until the artifact commit
  and focused mechanical checks are complete.

## Security Fix Implementation Evidence

- Existing `implementer`, expected/actual immutable `gpt-5.6-terra` / medium,
  resumed the accepted three-slice TDD sequence at `869a225d`, without
  subagents or Git mutation.
- Slice 1 RED begins with public constructor validation for both SF-007 message
  bounds. Exact command/result evidence follows in this section as each cycle
  completes.
- Slice 1 validation RED command: `pnpm
--config.verify-deps-before-run=false exec vitest run
packages/server/test/server/server.test.ts -t 'rejects invalid network message
bounds'`; exit 1, exactly 1 failed/21 skipped, expected throw absent. The
  whole-file sandbox `listen EPERM` attempt is excluded from behavior evidence.
- Slice 1 validation GREEN: the same command exited 0 with 1 passed/21 skipped.
- The next tracer is a real uncompressed command above a 512-byte public
  `readMaxBytes` bound; forwarding is temporarily absent to establish RED.
- Slice 1 uncompressed native RED: the focused services test exited 1 with 1
  failed/98 skipped because the oversized command resolved successfully. The
  preceding sandbox `listen EPERM` result is classified as environment-only.
- Slice 1 uncompressed native GREEN: same focused command exited 0 with 1
  passed/98 skipped. Compressed request and response-bound regressions were
  added next. Response forwarding native RED exited 1 with 1 failed/100 skipped
  because the oversized query response resolved successfully.
- Configured-bound native GREEN exited 0 with 3 passed/98 skipped. The exact
  4,194,304-byte default request-bound tracer is next; default behavior RED is
  confirmed natively: exit 1, 1 failed/101 skipped because the oversized
  payload resolved. The finite default is restored; GREEN is pending.
- Slice 1 default native GREEN exited 0 with 1 passed/101 skipped. SF-007 is
  implemented with public validation/TSDoc, direct Connect forwarding,
  configured compressed/uncompressed request and response tests, exact default
  behavior, and docs/security-artifact updates. Security re-review is pending.
- Slice 2 capacity RED exited 1 with 2 failed/102 skipped for the focused
  validation/concurrent-persistence command; the identical GREEN exited 0 with
  2 passed/102 skipped after the validated default-100 option and private ID
  reservation set were added.
- Slice 2 query RED exited 1 with 2 failed/104 skipped: implicit queries lacked
  a storage limit and a 1,001-row tenant returned all rows. The identical GREEN
  exited 0 with 2 passed/104 skipped after absent/zero wire limits began
  carrying the common 1,000-row storage cap.
- Focused rollback/release coverage exited 0 with 8 passed/103 skipped;
  recovery/CAS/queue/activation coverage exited 0 with 5 passed/109 skipped.
  Evidence covers pending, inactive, active, and recovery reservations,
  persistence/remember cleanup, observable delete failure after release,
  duplicate activation retention, capacity-before-CAS, unconsumed recovery on
  exhaustion, CAS loss/error release, queue overflow, and activation failure.
  SF-008/SF-009 are implemented pending re-review; SF-010 remains.
- Slice 2 full-file native verification passed 114/114; the preceding sandbox
  run's 19 loopback `listen EPERM` failures are environment-only.
- Slice 3 lexical/ownership/mode RED exited 1 with 4 failed/20 skipped; the
  identical GREEN exited 0 with 4 passed/20 skipped. A separate recheck RED
  exited 1 with 1 failed/26 skipped because mocked native connect was reached;
  restoring the immediate recheck yielded 1 passed/26 skipped.
- Native canonical alias/replacement coverage passed 3/3, the full ZeroMQ
  transport file passed 27/27, and the focused adapter/smoke/transport/
  cross-process set passed 4 files/40 tests after short macOS `/tmp` aliases
  replaced overlong test socket paths. Build typechecking passed.
- SF-010 now uses canonical one-component creation, exact POSIX owner/mode,
  prepared identity, and immediate native-boundary rechecks. The documented
  pathname post-check substitution residual remains deployment-owned. All four
  findings are implemented, but dedicated security re-review and task closure
  remain pending.
- Final focused runtime verification passed: the Server/SpineServices command
  exited 0 with 2 files/136 tests, and the native ZeroMQ adapter/smoke/
  transport/cross-process command exited 0 with 4 files/40 tests.
- `typecheck:generated` initially exited 2 on two test-only typing defects; after
  optional-state handling and a narrowed test-storage cast, the identical
  command exited 0 for both `tsc -b` and tooling `tsc --noEmit`.
- `docs:check` exited 0, verified 25 copied proto checksums, and verified 100
  proto, 28 core, 205 server, 19 storage, 17 transport, and 3 testing exports.
  Focused ESLint, Prettier check, and `git diff --check` all exited 0. Generated
  output remains ignored. These checks do not substitute for pending canonical
  review, final security re-review, full verification, or task closure.

## Coordinator Artifact Verification - Finding Batch 1

- `TM-002` through `TM-011` were assigned to different hypotheses than the
  accepted splitter result. Stable IDs must preserve this order: tenant
  identity binding, tenant propagation/isolation, malformed schema/`Any`,
  exposed intake, subscriptions, delivery retry/retention, local IPC,
  generated-module execution, dependencies, sensitive diagnostics, lifecycle
  cleanup, and regex/analyzer work.
- The scope says consumers own all persistence, but the accepted boundary says
  consumers own production persistence adapters/deployment while framework
  storage and tenant behavior remain in scope.
- The compact threat table does not yet expose each hypothesis's asset,
  investigation/status, and realistic prerequisite clearly enough to satisfy
  the accepted artifact contract.
- Return this complete batch to the same implementer context before artifact
  commit and dedicated security review.

## Finding Batch 1 Resolution

- Same implementer agent `019f62d7-31cc-7c13-a0b1-61d25dff9e23`, immutable
  actual `gpt-5.6-terra` / medium, restored the exact stable threat mapping,
  narrowed persistence ownership, and expanded required threat fields.
- Coordinator re-read the corrected artifacts and reran the focused pre-review
  lint. Prettier, docs/TypeDoc/API checks, status and policy scans, secret and
  public-leak scans, generated tracking, stable-ID scan, and diff integrity are
  clean.
- The implementer is closed. Dedicated security review may proceed from the
  committed artifact endpoint.

## Dedicated Security Reviewer Assignment

- Existing `security_reviewer`, expected explicit `gpt-5.6-terra` / high,
  read-only against the immutable review package, no subagents or Git mutation.
- Review the whole release surface through the bounded `TM-*` hypotheses and
  report concrete findings only. Historical superseded text is inactive unless
  a current task/status record or changed public doc claims it as active.
- Artifact endpoint `039aabd4`; immutable package
  `.superpowers/sdd/review-39f2c6f7..039aabd4.diff` (4 commits, 59,729 bytes).
- Reviewer agent `019f62e5-7a3b-7e50-84d3-7f7991ffe7a5` was explicitly
  dispatched as the existing `security_reviewer` with model
  `gpt-5.6-terra` and reasoning `high`; immutable role metadata confirms actual
  `gpt-5.6-terra` / high. No subagents or Git mutation are permitted.

## Dedicated Security Review Round 1

- Actual immutable profile matched dispatch: `gpt-5.6-terra` / high. Required
  security skills were applied, no subagents were spawned, no repository/Git
  mutation occurred, and the reviewer is closed.
- `SF-007` - High, high confidence, TB-01: `createHttpServer()` does not pass
  `readMaxBytes`/`writeMaxBytes`; Connect 2.1.2 defaults both to `0xffffffff`.
  A reachable caller can force excessive pre-validation buffering or
  decompression. Add finite validated limits and oversized compressed/
  uncompressed network regressions.
- `SF-008` - High, high confidence, TB-01/TB-02: every subscribe creates a UUID,
  durable record, timer, and later listener/queue, but only inactive TTL and
  per-subscription queue limits exist. Add one total-capacity reservation with
  exact rollback/release across persistence failure, expiry, cancellation, and
  stream cleanup; cover concurrent saturation.
- `SF-009` - Medium, high confidence, TB-01/TB-02: omitted query format is
  accepted and include-all produces an unbounded storage query. Apply a finite
  default or require a positive limit; cover more than 1,000 rows and tenant
  filtering.
- `SF-010` - Medium, high confidence, TB-06: IPC validation uses `stat()` and
  mode bits only. Reject final/ancestor symlinks, require effective-UID
  ownership on POSIX, recheck before bind, and test symlink/foreign-owner paths.
- `SF-001`, `SF-003`, `SF-004`, and `SF-006` remain accurate. `SF-002` is
  superseded by `SF-010`; `SF-005` is superseded in part by `SF-007` through
  `SF-009`. TM-004, TM-005, and TM-007 are confirmed; the remaining recorded
  hypotheses produced no confirmed defect. Round 1 is not clean.

## Security Fix Architecture Assignment

- Existing `requirements_splitter`, expected explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` / high,
  read-only, no subagents or Git mutation.
- Resolve public-contract/default ambiguity once, using Spine JVM/source and
  local Connect 2.1.2 evidence, before one implementer receives the full batch.
- Resumed splitter agent `019f62cb-d7fa-72b3-b0e9-d1ba22ff48c4` was explicitly
  redispatched with model `gpt-5.6-sol` and reasoning `high`; immutable actual
  profile is `gpt-5.6-sol` / high, read-only, without subagents or Git mutation.

## Accepted Security Fix Architecture

- The splitter completed and is closed. Accepted contracts are direct 4 MiB
  configurable Connect limits, default-100 idempotent subscription
  reservations, an implicit 1,000-row query safety limit with unchanged wire
  semantics, and root-to-leaf IPC link/identity checks with final POSIX
  ownership and mode enforcement.
- One existing implementer receives the complete finding batch and executes
  three sequential slices. Canonical concern review and security re-review wait
  for the full fix endpoint and focused verification.

## IPC Architecture Validation Finding

- Literal root-to-leaf link rejection conflicts with standard macOS `/var` and
  `/tmp` system symlinks and would break current IPC tests/configuration.
- Reopen only the `SF-010` path algorithm with the same splitter before
  implementation. Do not weaken final-directory ownership/mode/non-link checks
  or claim complete pathname-race elimination.

## Corrected IPC Architecture Disposition

- Existing splitter `019f62cb-d7fa-72b3-b0e9-d1ba22ff48c4` was resumed with
  explicit expected `gpt-5.6-sol` / high; immutable runtime metadata confirms
  actual `gpt-5.6-sol` / high. It remained read-only, spawned no children, and
  is closed.
- `SF-010` now permits only immutable root-owned POSIX ancestor aliases whose
  root-owned containing directory is not group/world writable, preserving
  standard macOS `/var` and `/tmp` aliases without accepting user-replaceable
  redirects.
- Preparation pins the followed existing anchor by `dev`/`ino` and `realpath`,
  creates missing components non-recursively, rejects a final link, validates
  final effective-UID ownership plus exact `0700`, and discards the lexical
  alias. Endpoint derivation and cleanup use only the canonical path.
- Each native bind/connect receives an immediate canonical-path, final-object,
  ownership, mode, and identity recheck. Non-POSIX behavior and the residual
  pathname race are documented without overclaiming portable guarantees.

## Coordinator Fix-Endpoint Finding

- SF-010 implementation currently rechecks a missing suffix component only on
  the `mkdir()` `EEXIST` path. A successful creation advances without the
  architecture-required immediate `lstat()` non-link/directory verification.
- Return this confirmed contract gap to the existing implementer with expected
  explicit immutable `gpt-5.6-terra` / medium. Canonical concern review and
  dedicated security re-review remain blocked on the corrected committed
  endpoint.

## Coordinator Fix-Endpoint Acceptance

- Existing implementer returned with actual immutable
  `gpt-5.6-terra` / medium, the required immediate successful-create check,
  focused RED/GREEN evidence, and no subagents or Git mutation; it is closed.
- Coordinator native affected verification passed 6 files/177 tests.
  Build/tooling typechecks, docs generation and exact API counts, focused
  ESLint/Prettier, status/public-leak/duplicate-policy/overclaim scans,
  generated-output tracking, and diff integrity all passed.
- Review basis may now advance to the committed complete-fix endpoint. Run all
  four canonical concerns as one wave before any fixes, then rerun the dedicated
  project security reviewer against the post-canonical endpoint.

## Coordinator IPC Correction Evidence

- Existing implementer `019f62d7-31cc-7c13-a0b1-61d25dff9e23`, immutable
  actual `gpt-5.6-terra` / medium, used one package-private filesystem seam and
  changed no public interface or Git state.
- Focused RED exited 1 with 1 failed/27 skipped: replacing a successfully
  created first suffix with a symlink led to the later canonical-path error,
  proving immediate verification was absent.
- The minimal correction performs the same `lstat()` non-link/directory check
  after both successful `mkdir()` and `EEXIST`, before advancing. Focused GREEN
  exited 0 with 1 passed/27 skipped; full native signal-transport regression
  exited 0 with 1 file/28 tests.
- SF-010 is restored to implemented pending dedicated security re-review.
  Canonical review, full verification, integration, and task closure remain
  pending.
