# T-0037e2 Review Log

Status: Architecture resolution assigned

Derived status mirror: the canonical current state is the `Status` header in
`build-protocol/tasks/T-0037e2-reusable-generation-stop/TASK.md`.

- Security review is deferred to T-0041 unless explicitly requested.
- Canonical concerns are code style/maintainability, documentation,
  TypeScript/API docs, and performance/reliability. Each implementation slice
  receives all four concerns after focused verification; N/A requires a
  concrete reason.
- No review package exists before architecture and implementation. Historical
  superseded parent text is non-actionable unless the current task or changed
  docs claim it as active.
- One existing requirements splitter is assigned at explicit
  `gpt-5.6-sol` / `high`, documentation-only ownership, and no subagents. Its
  accepted result must define the sole reusable-stop caller, transition owner,
  four ordered phases, exact retry/checkpoint boundaries, racing-attach policy,
  and small TDD slices without adding public surface.
