Security is deferred to final project readiness.

## Review Criteria

- Confirm D-0086 changes sequencing only and preserves every active D-0085
  lifecycle invariant.
- Confirm all six child briefs are Candidate/not started, ordered by dependency,
  independently reviewable, and assign each invariant to exactly one child.
- Confirm every child states objective, exact ownership, likely files, TDD
  acceptance, inherited D-0085 invariants, and explicit exclusions.
- Confirm current code facts are phrased as current facts, especially optional-
  closeable environment delivery, immediate tenant-specific exact drains,
  tenant startup enumeration gap, actual built-context storage, flat server
  close ordering, and unchanged T-0036 evidence.
- Confirm JVM evidence is limited to environment ownership and post-persist
  readiness, while singleton/threads/repeat callbacks/public monitor/catch-up
  station/global storage copying remain rejected.
- Confirm no runtime, tests, examples, generated files, public API docs, child
  branches, child work logs, or child review logs were created.
- Historical superseded text is non-actionable unless current task records or
  changed active docs claim it.
- No public lifecycle, monitor, scheduler, retry-policy, or adapter API may
  appear without a new accepted decision.

## Rounds

- `2026-07-12T04:15:00Z`: Created review scaffold. No reviewer is assigned;
  requirements splitting and coordinator scope validation are first.
- `2026-07-12T04:18:00Z`: Assigned read-only requirements splitter
  `019f548a-4e89-7183-867e-c52d97bd6b0b`; required implementation review lanes
  remain unassigned.
- `2026-07-12T04:25:00Z`: Closed the splitter and accepted six child slices.
  Parent T-0037 is now a docs/sequencing task. A single docs author must create
  the durable child briefs and invariant map before the four required review
  lanes are assigned.
- `2026-07-12T04:28:00Z`: Assigned split author
  `019f5492-4938-7522-a8c4-ddff533eab67`. Four required lanes remain pending
  author return, coordinator verification, and fixed-baseline packaging.
- `2026-07-12T04:29:15Z`: Split author produced the D-0086 sequencing package,
  six child briefs, split report, architecture reconciliation, and durable
  status updates. No reviewer has been assigned and no lane result is claimed;
  author verification and coordinator fixed-baseline packaging remain first.
- `2026-07-12T04:31:28Z`: Split author completed docs, formatting, whitespace,
  exact-scope, and child-artifact verification after the standard generated
  declaration bootstrap. This is author evidence only. All four required lanes
  remain pending with no reviewer assigned and no review result claimed.
- `2026-07-12T04:34:00Z`: Coordinator closed the author, corrected lightweight
  status-lint findings, and repeated docs/API, formatting, whitespace, and exact
  scope checks successfully. Fixed-baseline commit/package generation and all
  four lanes remain.
- `2026-07-12T04:35:00Z`: Committed split package as `7ff3d50a` and reconciled
  its active ledger. Fixed-baseline package generation and all four lanes are
  next.
- `2026-07-12T04:37:00Z`: Generated package
  `.superpowers/sdd/review-0308bc4a..1057a425.diff` (57,891 bytes) and assigned
  all four required independent lanes. Prompts explicitly ignore superseded
  history unless active records still claim it.
- `2026-07-12T04:42:00Z`: Closed all Round 1 lanes. Accepted complete batch:
  per-row readiness for partial batches, bounded lossless scope coalescing, a
  pre-attachment authoritative retirement primitive with non-overlapping
  callers, server-owned failed-start permanent cleanup, complete inherited
  child ledgers, and accurate declaration/direct compatibility wording. Fresh
  review waits for one docs fix worker, verification, and commit.
