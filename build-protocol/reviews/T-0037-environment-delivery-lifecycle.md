## Required Review Lanes

| Lane                       | Reviewer | Status  |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Code style/maintainability | pending  | Pending |
| Documentation              | pending  | Pending |
| TypeScript/API docs        | pending  | Pending |
| Performance/reliability    | pending  | Pending |

Security is deferred to final project readiness.

## Review Criteria

- To be finalized by the requirements split before implementation.
- Historical superseded text is non-actionable unless current task records or
  changed active docs claim it.
- No public lifecycle, monitor, scheduler, retry-policy, or adapter API may
  appear without a new accepted decision.

## Rounds

- `2026-07-12T04:15:00Z`: Created review scaffold. No reviewer is assigned;
  requirements splitting and coordinator scope validation are first.
- `2026-07-12T04:18:00Z`: Assigned read-only requirements splitter
  `019f548a-4e89-7183-867e-c52d97bd6b0b`; required implementation review lanes
  remain unassigned.
- `2026-07-12T04:25:00Z`: Closed the splitter and accepted six child slices.
  Parent T-0037 is now a docs/sequencing task. A single docs author must create
  the durable child briefs and invariant map before the four required review
  lanes are assigned.
